    "## System description\n",
    "After consulting different experts in the area of hydraulic systems (a nautic engineer and a physicist) and some bibliography review, it has been possible to understand: how the system components work, the system working principle and the different operating points. In the following sections all the gathered information will be explained. \n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Components description:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **2/2-way valves**: These valves can take only two states, completely open or closed. Each position the valve can take is represented by a square. These valves need a control signal to change its normal state. [more info](https://www.hafner-pneumatik.com/images/catalog/Chapter%205%20-%20Schemes%20of%20directional%20control%20valves%20-%20ISO-symbols.pdf) *normally closed*: V1, V2, V3, V4, V10. *normally open* V6. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/2%20way%20valve.png' alt = '2/2 way valve' width='260' height='310'> \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pressure relieve valves**: This type of valve is designed to maintain an optimum pressure level. The valve is preset at a given pressure and, as the pressure in the line increases, gradually opens discharging the necessary amount of fluid required to  drop the pressure to acceptable levels. These valves prevent damages to the system, as it is the case for V7 and V8 in the schematic **a**. Nevertheless, V11 is used for other purposes, its preset relief pressure will change in time during the working cycles and it is considered as the **load**. Its function in the system will be explained further. For nice explanation watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyizWUpPt28)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/pressure_relief_valve.png' alt = 'pressure_relief_valve' width='130' height='200'> \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adjustable flow control valve**: This is a valve with changeable aperture, used to regulate the flow rate and fluid pressure. The aperture closes to decrease the flow rate or opens to increase the flow rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/flow_control_valve.png' alt = 'flow_control_valve' width='130' height='200'> \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flow control (flow restrictor) valve**: As the adjustable flow control valve, it regulates the flow rate of the fluid but the cross-section of the valve is not changeable.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src='images/2-flow-control-valve.png' alt = 'flow_control_valve_2' width='140' height='210'> \n",
    " \n",
    "4. **Filters**: Filters are hydraulic components that catch contaminants or damaging particles in suspension present in the hydraulic fluid. In the system under study, F1 and F2 are filters.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src='images/filter.png' alt = 'filter' width='130' height='200'> \n",
    " \n",
    "5. **Heat exchanger (cooler)**: Such components use air or water to cool fluid in hydraulic systems. They pass liquid through a coil or core to cool it before it enters the system. C1 is the cooler in the system **b** and it uses air as coolant.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src='images/cooler.gif' alt = 'cooler' width='130' height='200'> \n",
    " \n",
    "6. **Hydraulic pump**: It is an electromechanical device that converts mechanical power into hydraulic energy. It injects liquid to the hydraulic system (e.g. oil, water,refrigerant,etc) from a tank or reservoir, they do so generating flow with enough power to overcome pressure induced by a load at the pump outlet. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/pump.jpg' alt = 'pump' width='90' height='160'>\n",
    "\n",
    "<!---\n",
    "When the pump operates, it creates a vacuum at its inlet which forces liquid from the reservoir into the pump inlet line, and by mechanical action delivers this liquid to the pump outlet and forces it into the hydraulic system. \n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Tank/ Reservoir**: Place where the liquid to be injected in the hydraulic system is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src='images/reservoir.png' alt = 'pump' width='90' height='160'> \n",
    " \n",
    "8. **Accumulators**: It is a pressure vessel used for different porpuses such as maintain pressure, store and recapture energy, reduce pressure peaks, power chassis suspensions, and dampen shock, vibration and pulsations. Under gas pressure, accumulators store a volume of fluid that can be re-fed into the hydraulic system when it is needed. With a rise in pressure within the hydraulic system, the hydraulic accumulator collects the pressure fluid. As a consequence, the gas is compressed. If the pressure falls, the compressed gas expands again and forces the stored fluid into the hydraulic circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/accumulator.png' alt = 'accumulator' width='60' height='130'>\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. System working principle\n",
    "The working circuit (**a**) is equipped with the main pump MP1, which injects oil to the system from the tank. Since the valve states change the oil flow path, different cases will be explained to ilustrate the system operation points.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **All valves are closed except for V6 (normally open)**. All the oil returns to the tank through V6 since this is the minimum effort path. PS1 would measure 0 bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **All valves are closed**. The oil flows through either V7 or V8 (the one with smaller preset pressure) and return to the tank. PS1 would measure the preset pressure at which the valve that is open was configurated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **All valves are closed except for V10**. The oil flows through V10 and, when it arrives at the junction where V11 and CS sensor are, most of the oil moves forward through V11 and few oil left would flow through the sensor. The last path impart a higher resistance to the oil flow due to the control flow valve placed after CS sensor. In this condition the pressure registered at PS1 would be equal to the one registered at PS2, both equal to the preset pressure at which V11 was configurated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!---\n",
    "If V6 and V10 were both closed, the pressure in the line would increases up to the relief pressure set in V8, there on the oil will flow freely through V8. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do Pumps Create Pressure or Flow? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3i_5xP9PYU\n",
    "The Difference Between Pressure and Flow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyizWUpPt28\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "**About the system load**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to highlight that hydraulic pump does not \"*decide*\" the pressure and flow rate it will deliver, this \"*decision*\" is taken by the system the pump is connected to. Pressure and flow rate at which the pump will be working depend on the requirements imposed by the system it is connected to, and the pump characteristics itself. To understand better this fact, please refer to the video [Do Pumps Create Pressure or Flow?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3i_5xP9PYU).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the previous idea in mind, referring to the working circuit (**a**), when V10 is open, V11 determines the pressure under which the pump is going to be working and the corresponding flow rate. According to what it was explained by the authors providing the data [(paper)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7151267), the pressure at which the valve V11 is preset changes to different levels whithin individual working cycles, hence the pump is subject to a cyclic changing load.

    "Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is an algorithm used in causal inference and graphical modeling to discover the underlying causal relationships among variables from observational data. It aims to identify the Markov equivalence class, which consists of all the graphs that encode the same conditional independence relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GES algorithm starts with an empty graph and incrementally adds and removes edges to explore different graph structures. It follows a greedy search strategy, evaluating the addition and deletion of edges based on certain conditions and statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm iterates through the variables and considers all possible edge additions and deletions involving the current variable. It evaluates the candidate edges based on the orientation rules, conditional independence tests, and a scoring metric such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The scoring metric is used to assess the goodness of fit of each candidate graph structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the addition step, GES tests the causal sufficiency and faithfulness assumptions to determine the orientation of the edge. If the edge passes these tests, it is added to the graph. In the deletion step, the algorithm checks for unshielded colliders (v-structures) and removes the edges accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "GES continues iterating through the variables until no more changes to the graph structure can be made. The resulting graph represents the Markov equivalence class of the underlying causal structure that is consistent with the observed conditional independence relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is decided to apply this algorithm to the hydraulic system described above in order to find the causal relations in a fast way even if it is sensitive to the assumptions it relies on, such as the causal Markov condition and faithfulness. Violations of these assumptions can lead to incorrect causal inferences. Additionally, GES does not guarantee the discovery of the true causal structure in all cases, as there might be multiple equivalent graphs consistent with the data."

    "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a subset of Deep Learning methodologies specifically designed for conducting inference on data structured as graphs. A graph in computer science is a data structure comprised of vertices (also referred to as nodes), representing objects within the structure, and edges, denoting relationships between the nodes. The definition of a graph is represented as G = VE, where V represents the set of vertices and E represents the set of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs serve the purpose of modeling a collection of nodes and their respective relationships. The relationships between nodes can be categorized into two types: directed edges, indicated by arrows to denote a directional dependency between the nodes, and undirected edges, which lack any directional association.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of a GNN architecture is to acquire an embedding that encapsulates neighborhood information. Graph analysis, being a distinct non-Euclidean framework for machine learning, encompasses tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and clustering. GNNs, being based on deep learning principles, operate within the graph domain and have gained significant popularity as a compelling graph analysis approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "A GNN functions by propagating information along the graph edges to update node representations. In essence, the network aggregates information from neighboring nodes iteratively, employing this information to revise its own representation. This iterative process continues until the nodes converge towards a stable representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principal advantage of employing GNNs lies in their capacity to handle intricate graph-structured data. They excel at capturing non-linear relationships among nodes and can generalize effectively to unseen data instances. Moreover, GNNs can be employed for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks, rendering them a versatile tool for numerous applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a drawback of GNNs is their potential for high computational demands, particularly when dealing with large-scale graphs. Furthermore, GNNs may suffer from overfitting, particularly when the graph structure exhibits noise or incompleteness. Finally, the interpretability of GNNs can present challenges, as comprehending the rationale behind the network's predictions can often be arduous.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to investigate the relationships among the sensors within the aforementioned system, the decision is made to incorporate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as an additional analytical approach. To ensure a consistent comparison, the hydraulic system as a whole is once again divided into distinct subsystems, denoted as subsystems **a** and **b**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been chosen to test also GNN for three main reasons:\n",
    "1. GNN is specifically designed to handle graph-structured data,\n",
    "\n",
    "2. GNN excels at capturing both local and global dependencies within a graph,\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GNN can generalize well to unseen data and capture non-linear relationships between nodes. In fact, it can learn complex patterns and representations, making them powerful tools for various machine learning tasks."

    "The examination of the obtained graph pertaining to subsystem **b** reveals a notable proximity between the observed results and the assumed ground truth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, it is evident that the variables $P5$ and $P6$ exhibit a consistent influence on the behavior of $FS2$. This coherence is attributed to the principle that an increase in pressure corresponds to an augmented flow rate.\n",
    "Furthermore, it is important to note that variations in the flow rate also induce fluctuations in temperature, thereby rationalizing the associations between $FS2$ and the temperature sensors $TS3$ and $TS4$.\n",
    "With regard to the edges linking $PS5$ and $PS6$ with $TS3$ and $TS4$, although a direct causal relationship is absent, it is not entirely unfounded since these variables are interconnected through their dependency on $FS2$.\n",
    "Then, how expected, there is a connection from $TS3$ and $CE$ in accordance with the fact that, as explained in the paper, $CE$ is defined as: $$CE = \\frac{TS4-TS3}{TS3-T_{env}}$$\n",
    "where $T_{env}$ is the temperature of the environment. in spite of this, it was thought that $CE$ also depended on $TS4$, but this was not the case from this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing this graph with the corresponding one obtained using GES, it is possible to observe that the first is more accurate than the second. This is due to the fact that the GES algorithm relies on certain assumptions, such as the faithfulness assumption and the causal Markov condition. Violations of these assumptions can lead to incorrect causal inference. Additionally, the GES algorithm may struggle with identifiability issues in certain scenarios.\n",
    "In addition the GES algorithm involves making choices of parameters and thresholds, which can impact the results. The algorithm's outcomes may vary depending on these choices, and selecting appropriate values can be challenging.\n",
    "Despite this, the GES algorithm is scalable and can handle large datasets efficiently. It can be applied to high-dimensional data with a large number of variables and the computational time is lower with respect to the one required by GNN."
